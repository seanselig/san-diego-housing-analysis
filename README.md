San Diego Housing Market Analysis

Project Overview
This project delves into the residential housing market of San Diego, California, to uncover key trends and dynamics. Leveraging publicly available housing data, this analysis aims to provide actionable insights for potential homebuyers, sellers, and real estate investors.

Questions Addressed
This analysis specifically seeks to answer the following questions:

1. How do median housing prices per square foot and median days on market vary by property type (e.g., single-family, condo, townhome) in San Diego, indicating potential value or market speed for different housing segments?

2. How do median housing prices and market dynamics (e.g., median price per square foot, days on market) vary significantly across different sub-regions (e.g., zip codes or specific areas represented by the REGION column) within San Diego?

3. How have average/median housing prices in San Diego changed over a specific time period (e.g., the last 5 years), and are there any observable seasonal trends?

4. What is the relationship between median sale price (or median price per square foot) and the median days on market in San Diego, and how does this relationship change over time or by property type?
